Summary:
ORCA, a distributed serving system, introduces iteration-level scheduling - a new 
scheduling mechanism that let finished requests return immediately and new ones 
join after just one decode step, and selective batching - applies batching only to a 
selected set of operations, in order to apply batching and iteration-level 
scheduling to a Transformer model at the same time. It then scales with 
intra-/inter-layer model parallelism and a scheduler that manages memory and 
pipelined execution across workers, significantly outperforming NVIDIA 
FastTransformer in throughput at the same level of latency, on GPT3-class 
models (up to 175B, scaling to 341B.
Question:
1. List one benefit and one drawback of iterative scheduling (as compared to 
request-level scheduling.
Benefit: Let finish requests return earlier, potentially after each iteration. And let 
new ones join after each decode step as well. It avoids wasting compute on 
“inactiveˮ requests and unnecessary blocking, reducing delay and improving 
throughput.
Drawback: Higher complexity and limited batching of attention. Because requests 
in the same batch can be at different token positions, the core Attention ops canʼt 
be cleanly batched. Thus, Orca introduces selective batching and tighter 
scheduler – engine integration, which increases system complexity and 
engineering overhead.
