Summary:
dLoRA OSDI ʼ24 is an inference serving system for LoRA-tuned LLMs that 
boosts efficiency by dynamically choosing between running adapters merged into 
the base model vs. unmerged (cross-adapter batching), and by co-migrating 
requests and adapters across replicas to fix load imbalance. It uses a credit-based 
batching policy to decide when to merge/unmerge and an ILP-guided, selective 
migration scheme to rebalance replicas, accounting for execution time, queueing 
delay, and switching overhead. On real traces, dLoRA improves throughput by up 
to 57.9 over vLLM and 26.0 over HF PEFT, and achieves up to 1.8 lower 
average latency than concurrent SLoRA. 
Questions:
 What is the pros and cons of merged and unmerged adapter in LoRA 
inference?
Merged (adapter fused into base weights):
Pros: no extra per-token adapter matmuls/adds → lowest compute overhead 
when many requests use the same adapter. 
Cons: you lose cross-adapter batching (canʼt share the base compute across 
mixed adapters), so itʼs inefficient when traffic is diverse across adapters. 
Unmerged (keep adapters separate):
Pros: lets you batch across different adapters by sharing the base modelʼs 
compute, improving utilization under mixed workloads. 
Cons: when requests are skewed to one adapter, you still pay adapter apply 
cost each step; merged inference would be cheaper.
 Can Algorithm 2 in the paper lead to request starvation? If so, how does 
dLoRA solve it?
Yes. Their dynamic batching favors the most loaded adapter type to decide 
merging/unmerging, which can starve other adapters. dLoRA adds a credit-based

starvation-prevention scheme: it tracks per-adapter credits, serves starved 
adapters first once credits accumulate, transfers credits when FCFS order is 
preempted, and even blocks merging for adapters without sufficient credit; 
thresholds (e.g., T starve) damp oscillation.
